# E0033

The import value is never used directly.

In MoonBit, you can import a value (say `f`) from another package into current
package, so that you don't have to use `@pkg.f` to qualify the value, and you
can just use `f` as if it were defined in this package. However, if `f` is not
used in current package, this warning will be emitted.

## Erroneous example

`lib/moon.pkg.json`:

```json
{}
```

`lib/main.mbt`:

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0033_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

`main/moon.pkg.json`:

```json
{
  "is-main": true,
  "import": [
    {
      "path": "username/hello/lib",
      "alias": "hello",
      "value": [
        "greeting" // Warning: The import value greeting is never used directly.
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

`main/main.mbt`:

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0033_error/top_1.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

It is possible that you still use qualified name to access the imported value.
In this case, either remove the imported value from `moon.pkg.json`.

`main/moon.pkg.json`:

```json
{
  // ...
  "import": [
    {
      "path": "username/hello/lib",
      "alias": "hello"
    }
  ]
}
```

Or remove the qualified package name from your code:

`main/main.mbt`:

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0033_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
