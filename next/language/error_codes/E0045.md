# E0045

Traits with only default implementation need to be explicit implemented with
`impl Trait for Type`.

Initially, if all methods of a trait have default implementations, MoonBit
allowed **any** types to implicitly implement that trait without an explicit
`impl` declaration. This behavior is now deprecated, and you should explicitly
implement traits using the `impl Trait for Type` syntax. Currently, this
deprecation is going through a "graceful migration" period, and this warning
will be emitted if your code uses implicit trait implementation.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0045_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

Add an explicit `impl` declaration for types that you wish to implement the
trait for.

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0045_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
:start-after: start example
```
