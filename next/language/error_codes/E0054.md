# E0054

Async function or method is missing the error annotation.

Asynchronous functions and methods are expected to specify the errors they can
raise.If an async function or method is guaranteed **not** to raise any errors,
it must be explicitly marked with the
[`noraise`](/language/error-handling.md#throwing-errors) annotation. This
clarifies the function's behavior for anyone using it.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0054_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

Add `noraise` or `raise E` to the function signature.

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0054_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
