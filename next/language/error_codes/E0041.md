# E0041

Closed map pattern.

MoonBit's map pattern syntax does not support closed pattern
(i.e. asserting that the map does not contain any other unmatched elements).
So map patterns must always contain a `..`, otherwise this warning will be reported.

## Erroneous example
```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0041_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion
- If the intended semantic is open matching (i.e. allow existence of unmatched elements),
  just add `..` to the map pattern.
- If the intended semantic is closed matching, use pattern guard instead:
    ```moonbit
    fn f(map : Map[String, Int]) -> Unit {
      match map {
        { "x": x, "y": y, .. } if map.size() == 2 => println(x + y)
        _ => ()
      }
    }
    ```
