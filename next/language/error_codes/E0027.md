# E0027

The syntax is deprecated. Please refer to the warning message on the reason and potential fix.

For example, one of the deprecated usage is using constructors as functions. Instead, partial
application should be used to create a function from a constructor.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0027_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

Migrate the code according to the warning message. In this case, the code should
be changed to use the partial application syntax.

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0027_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
