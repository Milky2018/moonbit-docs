# E4007

Enum variants without payloads are considered as singleton values. MoonBit does
not allow such constructors to be called as functions.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4007_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

Remove the function calling syntax from the constructor:

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4007_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

If you really need the constructor to construct values, explicitly use `Unit` as
its argument

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4007_fixed/top_1.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
