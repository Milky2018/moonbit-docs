# E4125

`?` operator cannot be used with `..`.

`..` operator allows chaining of method call that returns `Unit`. This is
especially useful when the method performs side-effects, like modifying the
object itself, and thus returns `Unit`.

Using `?` materializes the error that will be raised by the method to
`Result[T, E]`. If one combine the `?` with `..`, the method call will return
`Result[T, E]` instead of `Unit`, which is not allowed by the `..` operator.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4125_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

Use the single dot syntax to call the method, and store the result in a
variable.

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4125_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
