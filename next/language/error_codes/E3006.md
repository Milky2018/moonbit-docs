# E3006

There is no individual visibility control for enum constructors.

Usually, this means that you put an `priv` or `pub` visibility modifier on a enum constructor.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E3006_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

Remove the visibility modifier from the definition of the enum constructor:

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E3006_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
