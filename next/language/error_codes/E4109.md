# E4109

Return must be inside a function.

This error occurs when a `return` statement is used outside of a function. In
MoonBit, `return` statements must be inside a function body.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4109_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

To fix this error, you can remove the return statement from the let binding:

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4109_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
