# E0014

Type name should be capitalized. In MoonBit, we recommend using a capitalized type name for all types, including built-in types and user-defined types. This is a convention that is followed by the standard library and most of the community code.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0014_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

Capitalize the type name.

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0014_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
