# E0017

The usage of identifier is ambiguous. If it refers to the loop variable, please
use `as <id>` to bind it in the pattern. If it refers to the original value of
the variable before entering the loop, please bind it to a new binder outside
the loop.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0017_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
:start-after: start example
:end-before: end example
:prepend: "///|\nfn main {"
:append: "}"
```

Output:

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0017_error/__snapshot__/snapshot
```

Because `a` refers to the value of `a` before entering the loop, therefore the
value is always the same.

## Suggestion

It is often the case that you may want to refer to the loop variable that
changes with loop iterations. If so, use `as <id>` to bind it in the pattern.

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0017_fixed/example_0.mbt
:language: moonbit
:start-after: start example
:end-before: end example
:prepend: "///|\nfn main {"
:append: "}"
```

Output:

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0017_fixed/__snapshot__/snapshot_0
```

Or, if you want to refer to the original value of the variable before entering
the loop, explicitly bind it to another name outside the loop.

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0017_fixed/example_1.mbt
:language: moonbit
:start-after: start example
:end-before: end example
:prepend: "///|\nfn main {"
:append: "}"
```

Output:

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0017_fixed/__snapshot__/snapshot_1
```
