# E3001

This source files contains invalid or incomplete tokens.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E3001_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

This example gives the following error on line 2:

```
Lexing error: unrecognized character u32:0x27
```

... which indicates that the compiler don't know how to interpret
the dangling character `'` (ASCII 0x27) on that line as a part of
a MoonBit token.

## Suggestion

Change your code to strictly follow the MoonBit syntax rules,
so that it only contains valid MoonBit tokens.

In the above example, the missing closing apostrophe should be added:

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E3001_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
