# E4052

The type/trait name duplicates with a previously defined identifier.

This can happen when you define a type and a trait with the same name.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4052_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

Rename either the type or the trait to a different name.

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4052_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
