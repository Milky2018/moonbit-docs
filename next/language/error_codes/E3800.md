# E3800

Expecting a newline or `;` here, but encountered another delimiter.

Constructors in `enum` definition, fields in `struct` definition, and
constructors in error type `type!` definition, should be separated by a newline
or a `;`. It is so common for AI to generate code with a wrong delimiter `,`
that we specifically catch this error to help you and AI fix it.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E3800_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

Replace `,` with a newline or `;` as appropriate. We suggest using a newline
since it conforms to the MoonBit style suggested by the MoonBit formatter.

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E3800_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
