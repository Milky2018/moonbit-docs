# E4061

Cannot implement a trait for a type when both are defined in other packages.

MoonBit follows the orphan rule, which means that you can only:

| Traits  | Types   | Allowed? |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Current Package | Current Package | Yes      |
| Other Package | Current Package | Yes      |
| Current Package | Other Package | Yes      |
| Other Package | Other Package | No       |

See the [Access control of methods and trait implementations](../packages.md#trait-implementations)
section of the MoonBit documentation for more information.

## Erroneous example

Suppose you have type `A` and trait `B` defined in package `a` in module
`username/hello`:

`a/a.mbt`:

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4061_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

`a/moon.pkg.json`:

```json
{}
```

Now, if you want to implement trait `@a.B` for type `@a.A`:

`b/moon.pkg.json`:

```json
{
  "import": [
    "username/hello/a"
  ]
}
```

`b/b.mbt`:

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4061_error/top_1.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

MoonBit will report an error.

## Suggestion

You can move either the trait or type into the current package where the
implementation is in. If that is not possible, you can create a new type over
the type you wish to implement the trait for, and then implement the trait for
the new type:

`b/b.mbt`:

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4061_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
