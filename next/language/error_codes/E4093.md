# E4093

The type is not a struct type.

This error occurs when you try to construct a type that is not a `struct` using
the `T::{ .. }` syntax.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4093_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

You should use the correct syntax to construct the type.

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4093_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
