# E0028

Unfinished code. In MoonBit, you can use `...` to mark a piece of code that is incomplete. You can still compile and run the code, but it will cause a runtime error when it is executed.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0028_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

Complete the code:

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0028_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
