# E4136

This expression has type that is not a newtype.

In MoonBit, you can access the field of underlying struct of a newtype by using
the dot access operator (`.`). However, you cannot access the field of a struct
if it is not wrapped in a newtype.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4136_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

If you want to access the field of the underlying struct, you should wrap the
in a newtype:

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4136_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
