# E4103

This loop has incorrect number of patterns supplied.

This error occurs when the number of patterns in a loop arm does not match the
number of loop arguments. In a loop construct, each arm must have the same
number of patterns as there are loop arguments.

For example, if a loop takes 2 arguments, each arm must have exactly 2 patterns
to match against those arguments. Having too few or too many patterns will
trigger this error.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4103_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

To fix this error, ensure that each arm in the loop has the correct number of
patterns to match the loop arguments. For example,

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4103_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
