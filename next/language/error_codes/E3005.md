# E3005

There is no such visibility for the entity (function/type/trait/...).

Usually, this means that you put an `priv` visibility modifier on a entity is
by-default private.

See the [Access Control](/language/packages.md#access-control) section of for a
detailed explanation on the visibility in MoonBit.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E3005_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

Remove the visibility modifier from the definition of the entity:

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E3005_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
