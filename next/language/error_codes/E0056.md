# E0056

Missing field in struct pattern.

The warning is emitted when pattern matching on a
[struct pattern](/language/fundamentals.md#simple-patterns) and having missing
fields.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0056_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

Add `..` if you want to omit the other fields, or use them.

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0056_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
