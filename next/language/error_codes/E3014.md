# E3014

Inline wasm syntax error. MoonBit will check if the inline wasm syntax is correct, including:

- If the parenthesis are correctly matched.
- If the wasm instructions are correctly formatted.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E3014_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

Fix the inline wasm syntax as suggested by the warning message.

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E3014_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
