# E4116

Found hole _.

If you want to represent unfinished code, we recommend using `...` instead.
Using `...` allows the program to be compiled and run, while `_` will cause a
compilation error.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4116_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

Use `...` instead:

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4116_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
