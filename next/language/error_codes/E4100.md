# E4100

The type is not a trait.

This error occurs when you try to use the `typealias` syntax to define a alias
for a type and use it as a trait. As it is impossible to use a type as a trait,
this error might hint at a typo in your code.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4100_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

If there is a typo, the use a correct trait or alias of trait at where the error
occurs.

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4100_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

We recommend using `traitalias` for defining aliases for traits, as this will
detect errors like this earlier.
