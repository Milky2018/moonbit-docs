# E4039

There is no method with the specified name in this trait.

## Erroneous Example

```moonbit
let a : String = Show::to_str(42)
```

The example above tries to call the method `to_str` on the `Show` trait,
but the method is not defined in the trait, giving the following error on line 1:

```
There is no method to_str in trait Show
```

## Suggestion

Make sure that the method name is spelled correctly
and that it is defined in the trait:

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4039_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
