# E3002

This source files contains errors in the syntax of the code.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E3002_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

This example gives the following error on line 3:

```
Parse error, unexpected token `}`, you may expect `,` or `)`.
```

... which indicates a missing closing parenthesis (`)`) in the `println` function call.

## Suggestion

Change your code to strictly follow the MoonBit syntax rules.

In the above example, the missing closing parenthesis should be added:

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E3002_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
