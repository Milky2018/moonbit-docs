# E4066

Overloaded operator has inconsistent parameter type.

You can refer to the [Operator Overloading](../methods.md#operator-overloading)
section for a list of operators that can be overloaded, and respectively their
expected signature.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4066_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

Modify the method to match the expected parameter type of the operator. If you
use the name for overloaded operators by accident, you can rename the method to
a different name.

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4066_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
