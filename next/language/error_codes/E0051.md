# E0051

Ambiguous operator precedence.

Some operators have non-intuitive precedence and can lead to confusion. Always
use parentheses to make the intent clearer in these cases.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0051_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

Add parentheses to make the intent clearer.

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0051_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
