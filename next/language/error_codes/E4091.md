# E4091

The type has no field with the given name.

It is possible that you made a typo and use a wrong field name to access the
field of a struct.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4091_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

You can either add the missing field to the struct, or use an existing field
to access the struct.

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4091_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
