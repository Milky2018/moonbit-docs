# E0011

Partial match. The match/guard/loop expression does not cover all possible
cases.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0011_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

The warning message usually contains hints about the missing patterns. Add the missing cases to avoid incomplete matches.

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0011_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

Or, you can use `is` syntax to use this pattern matching as a condition:

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0011_fixed/top_1.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

Or, you can add a wildcard pattern to catch all remaining cases:

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0011_fixed/top_2.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
