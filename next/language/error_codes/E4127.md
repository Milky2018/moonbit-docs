# E4127

Type is not an error type.

MoonBit only allow error types (defined with `type!` keyword) to appear after
the exclamation mark (`!`) in the return type of a function.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4127_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

You can wrap the type you wish to raise in a error type:

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4127_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
