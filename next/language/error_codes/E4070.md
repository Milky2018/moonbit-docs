# E4070

Unknown intrinsic. This intrinsic is not known to the MoonBit compiler.

Note all intrinsic is not intended for usage outside of `moonbitlang/core` and
is subject to change without notice, and we highly recommend **against** using
them.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4070_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

You may probably want to use the `abort` function from the `moonbitlang/core`:

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4070_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

If you really need to use the intrinsic, you can check the source code of
`moonbitlang/core` for further usage of the corresponding intrinsic.
