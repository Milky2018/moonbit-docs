# E4149

Cannot call async function in this context.

Async functions can only be called in async functions.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4149_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

You can change the containing function to an async function:

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4149_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
