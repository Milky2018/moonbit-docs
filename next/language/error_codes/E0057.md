# E0057

Constructor pattern expect payload.

The warning is emitted when the payload part is missing from the constructor
pattern.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0057_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

Use `(_)` to ignore all the payloads.

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0057_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
