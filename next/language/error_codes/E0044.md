# E0044

Inline wasm code is invalid.

Either the inline wasm code has incorrect syntax, or it refers to unbound function.

## Erroneous example
```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0044_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion
Here are some pitfalls when writing inline wasm:

- all variables and functions must start with `$`
