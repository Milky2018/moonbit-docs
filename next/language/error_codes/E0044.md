# E0044

Inline wasm code is invalid.

The inline wasm code refers to unbound function.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0044_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

If you know that such a function does exist, manually override suppress the
warning. Notice that the compilation error will result in an
[internal compiler error](./E1001.md)

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0044_fixed/moon.pkg.json
:caption: moon.pkg.json
```
