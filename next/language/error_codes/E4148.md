# E4148

The loop label is undeclared.

MoonBit allows programmers to continue to or break from a loop with a label. The
label must be declared at the beginning of one of the loops the `continue` or
`break` statement is in.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4148_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

Make sure the label is declared at the beginning of the loop the `continue` or
`break` statement is in.

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4148_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
