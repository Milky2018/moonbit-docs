# E0040

This method is declared as `T::f`, Calling this kind of method directly via
name(..) is deprecated, use qualified syntax `T::f(..)`, or declare the method
as `fn f(self : A, ..)` instead.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0040_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

You can either modify the calling of this function at call sites:

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0040_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

Or you can define the method as:

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0040_fixed/top_1.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
